- A College-level social-educational web app application🍁.
- In this changing world of technology, staying updated is very important. So i-Connect is a platform exclusively for college students to connect, explore events, and join groups at their campus🥀. 
- Imagine a virtual and digital campus where you can engage in interconnected learning📌.
- With more and more colleges and institutions adopting digital means of connecting, students find it difficult to surf across these multiple sources to stay updated🎧.
- So, we decided to build this one-stop solution. This user-friendly website will facilitate dynamic cross generational knowledge exchange and aims to unite seniors and juniors and foster mentorship and community interaction within the campus🎭.
- Our objective is to seamlessly unite and empower students through the power of social media and digital interaction🌼.
- Our website will be based on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Google Groups, MS Teams and much more.  We will be referring to these websites for insights and their ideologies🌷.
- It allows the student community to make their public profiles by which they can exchange information, contribute, poll, and establish communities within the university🌴.
- Themes - Light and Dark
